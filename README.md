# My master thesis

This is the git repository for the source code of my master thesis *"An
efficient implementation of the Green cross approximation method on GPUs"*
based on [Approximation of integral operators by Green quadrature and nested
cross approximation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-015-0757-y) and
building on the implementation of the [Green cross approximation for boundary element methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07244) for the
[H2Lib](http://www.h2lib.org).
