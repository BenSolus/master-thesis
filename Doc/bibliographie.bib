abstract="We present a fast algorithm that constructs a data-sparse approximation of matrices arising in the context of integral equation methods for elliptic partial differential equations. The new algorithm uses Green's representation formula in combination with quadrature to obtain a first approximation of the kernel function, and then applies nested cross approximation to obtain a more efficient representation.
