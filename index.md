This is the website of my master thesis with the working title *"An efficient
implementation of the Green cross approximation method on GPGPUs"* based on the
article
[Approximation of integral operators by Green quadrature and nested cross approximation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-015-0757-y)
[\[1\]]({{ site.baseurl }}/refs). Here I am going to collecting ideas and
provide the documentation of the source code.
